### Project: Investigate a Dataset [TMDB Movie DataAnalysis]

Udacity-Project-Investigate-TMDB-Movies-Dataset
- I have to examine a dataset for this assignment, evaluate it, and then convey our conclusions. I'll facilitate your analysis using the Python tools NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.

I utilized the approximately 10,000 movies from the TMDB movie dataset. Insights regarding movie features will be analysed as part of this inquiry with the aim of assisting the film business in increasing its revenue.

** What do I need to install? You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:(pandas,NumPy,Matplotlib,csv) **
It will be recommend to installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.

**Why this Project?**
I have to go through the data analysis procedure for this project to see how everything comes together. In order to write Python code for data analysis much more easily, I have also used the NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib modules.

**What I've discovered.**
- Understand every stage of a typical data analysis process.
- Be at ease asking questions that a certain dataset can answer and then responding to those questions.
- Understand how to look into issues in a dataset and organise the data into a useable manner.
- Practice presenting the findings of your analysis.
- Use NumPy and pandas' vectorized operations to speed up your data analysis programmes.
- Learn how to use the Series and DataFrame objects in pandas, which make it easier to access your data.
- Understand how to create plots using Matplotlib to display your results.
